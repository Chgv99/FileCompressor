This project's objective is the compression of a group of files selected by the user from its machine.

The program will open an empty list where the files will be shown after selection.

This is done by going "Archivos -> Cargar". Then, the user needs to select a **folder** (only after that, in the previous window, the user will be able to select each file individually to add to the .zip).
